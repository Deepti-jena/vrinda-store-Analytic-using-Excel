Here is my data analytics project for Vrinda Store using ExcelSure, here is my data analytics project for Vrinda Store using Excel:
I started by collecting sales data from the past year and organizing it into a spreadsheet. Then, I used Excel's pivot tables and charts to analyze the sales trends, identify top-selling products, and track customer purchasing behavior. I also created a dashboard to visualize the key performance indicators and provide a quick overview of the store's performance. Overall, the project helped Vrinda Store gain valuable insights into their sales data and make informed business decisions.
